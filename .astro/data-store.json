[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) seems like the gold standard here and claims to be simple, but my first impression after looking into the documentation was anything but.

I could also keep using Svelte components if needed! The cube spinning on the front page at the time of writing is running on the magnificent [Threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) library that binds Three.js and Svelte together.
